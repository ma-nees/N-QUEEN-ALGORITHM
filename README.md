## ✨ Features

| Feature | Details |
|---------|---------|
| **Back‑tracking search** | Recursively explores safe positions and backtracks when conflicts occur. |
| **All solutions** | Prints every distinct arrangement of queens, not just one. |
| **Board visualization** | Outputs a 0 / 1 matrix for each solution (1 = queen). |
| **Easy to tweak** | Single self‑contained file `n_queens.c`, minimal dependencies. |
| **Up to 10 × 10** | Array is statically sized for boards ≤ 10; raise `board[10][10]` if you need larger. |
